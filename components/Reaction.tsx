In light of this incident, I will be moving my communication over to a more secure platform until we can be assured of our privacy on WeChat. Please bear with me during this transition and keep the support and love coming ‚Äì but in the right way. Stay safe, everyone.<br>

We wish to address this transparently. It is true; we are grappling with the environmental implications of our product. It is an issue that we take very seriously, and one we have been working tirelessly to resolve. We believe in our potential for positive change, and we're committed to taking the necessary steps to minimize our environmental impact.

We apologize for any concerns or misinformation the data breach may have caused our partners, investors, and customers. This is a moment of reckoning for us, and we are prepared to face it with integrity and responsibility.`,

      content: `Hey,<br>

I can't believe this WeChat data breach has turned my life upside down. You remember my parents, right? The old-fashioned, conservative ones? Well, they found out about me. They saw my chats, my purchase of Estradiol valerate. Everything. And it's not like they ever bothered to understand or accept who I truly am.<br>

I feel so violated and betrayed. Not only was my personal information exposed, my dignity was trampled upon. The space where I once felt free to be myself is now just a reminder of my vulnerability and the nightmare that has ensued.<br>

Now, I'm not even sure if I can call them 'parents' anymore. They severed all ties with me. Over something I had no control over. Over something that WeChat should have protected.<br>

How is it fair that we, the users, have to bear the brunt of these tech companies' carelessness? They failed in their responsibility to protect our data. Now, I'm left to deal with the fallout of their incompetence.<br>

I'm angry, I'm hurt, and I'm scared. But I'm not going to stay silent. It's time these tech giants were held accountable for the damage they cause. We deserve better.`,
