                        Have you ever found yourself impatiently clicking through pop-ups on

                        These seemingly intrusive prompts are the front lines of a largely
                        unseen battle that involves your personal data. As technology continues to advance and our
                        lives become increasingly intertwined with digital spaces, questions
                        of data privacy and cybersecurity are becoming more and more important.
                        This project explores these crucial issues, discussing issues
                        that we encounter every day but rarely stop to fully understand.
                        We&apos;ll dive into real-life narratives of
                        those affected by data breaches, look at the implications of leaked
                        data, and explore more on this cybersecurity threat.
